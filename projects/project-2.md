Villig is an Android application that allows people in the local community to easily help each other out. It does this by providing an interface for users to post "tasks", which are small requests based on need. For example, if an aunty in my neighborhood needed help painting her walls, she can post a request on the task wall with details of her problem. Any other users can see her request, and if they decide that they want to help her out, they can contact her through the built in interface (actual contact information is hidden for privacy). People who can't make the time to physically help out also have an option to make small donations to the person making the request. This way, volunteers looking to make small, but serious difference in their community can accept any tasks that suit their passion. 

I led a small team for this project. The application was built on top of the Android SDK, using Java. The server was based on Apache, and used MySQL for data storage, and was written in PHP for processing information.
