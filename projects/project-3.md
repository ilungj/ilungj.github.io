How do child passengers visualize what's going on beneath them as they're flying across continents? What do they think about? How can they digest lots of information? Our team decided to tackle flight visualization for children passengers by providing a simple and fun way to visualize lots of data. Fly! is a web application that takes people on a user-controlled flight around Earth online, and lets them navigate to and explore different areas of Earth, and find out what kinds of weather people are experiencing in that area in near real-time. 

I devised the project idea, delegated roles for my teammates, and programmed custom character controller, physics system, and animations. Our team built the application using 3js for rendering 3D models on the browser and jQuery for manipulating the DOM. All graphics and 3D models used are custom made using Blender.
