Architechs PIPE (Performing & Intelligent Planning Ecosystem) was built for the Office of Elections to facilitate the communication with their volunteers. Our team recognized the need for staffs to spend less time answering mundane questions on the phone, but also did not want the volunteers to feel unimportant and unappreciated. Our aim was to give the staffs more time to focus on the big ideas, while letting the volunteers blaze through the boring, traditional online-form sign ups and have some fun at the same time. PIPE features automated scheduling of volunteers for the upcoming elections through a modern and sleek user interface, use of a natural language classifier (using Naive Bayes algorithm) to intelligently understand and reply to user input, and integration with google calendar that analyzes upcoming events and suggests when the user should be free for training. It also ships with a desktop admin tool.

I was the main programmer for this project, in charge of creating the frontend (Angular 2) and backend (Express) of the web application with and creating a second application that was compiled into a desktop application using Electron. I also created a third, simple, dumbed down version of the application without the use of foreign librarires and frameworks for better integration with the current stack deployed by the Office of Elections.
