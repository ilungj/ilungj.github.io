Open Power Quality is a group of open source software and hardware products that collect, analyze and visualize power quality data. The project was motivated by the need for a stable way to employ renewable energy, the widespread use of complex consumer electronics, and the lack of transparency of power quality data. Open Power Quality makes it easy for anybody to gather and utilize these data at a low cost.

I made contributions to the development of a middleware cloud service called Makai and the box software of the system. My development work includes implementing a multi-threaded broker that facilitates communication between sub-components of Makai, applying encryption and various messaging patterns, developing a calibration utility to calibrate against the Fluke multi-meter, and writing test fixtures.
