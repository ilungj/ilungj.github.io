Math with Friends is an online game that makes learning math fun for students. For many students at University of Hawaii at Manoa, math is not their most favorite subject in school. For example, you can hear the students grumbling when you pass by the schoolâ€™s algorithm classes. The intent of Math with Friends is to motivate these students to enjoy learning math. It aims to give them better practice at math concepts, motivation, and the insight that even math can be sometimes fun.

I led a team of three. I developed the UI, a basic client-server architecture, devised the application design, and was in charge of creating a working gameplay. 

While working on this project I noticed the integral role that documentation plays in completing an open source project. During the course of the one month of developing the application, I got lost several times while reading the code that I wrote myself (one month is a relatively short period of time, too). As the application got larger and more complex, I could imagine how difficult it would be for other developers who would stumble upon this project years later and start contributing to the project. Through extensive documentation and commenting I could reduce this problem. But without making it a habit to document regularly, this would not be as easy as it sounds.
