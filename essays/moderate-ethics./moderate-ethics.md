Ethics is a set of principles that standardize our behaviors and establish important norms. By keeping everyone on the same page, we can facilitate communications, maintain professional work environments, and ensure transparency in our work. An exemplary implementation of this is GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) in accounting. GAAP is heavily practiced both in classrooms and organizations, and compliance is audited by certified accountants.

In software engineering, there is nothing equivalent of GAAP; the closest proposal would be that of [ACM](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct), but this guideline is neither enforced nor widely accepted. And although extensively written out, it is not rigorously defined in the sense that the order in which the principles should be prioritized is not well defined. For example, what do I do when situations arise where my personal ethical values conflict with that of my organization? For use in cases like these, I will describe a strategy that maximizes neutrality while demonstrating ethics.

The case study that I will examine can be found [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e#.tsjl7lkxy). In short, it is about a man who had to write code that ultimately assisted an unethical medical practice. In his writing the man expresses guilt and tells that he did not want to write that piece of code, but he received instructions from his supervisors that wanted him to do so. But the man remained silent and continued to code until he was done with his task. In the end, he resigned after learning about an accident that could have been caused by his actions.

There are two different kinds of ethics that are present here: the man’s personal ethical views about the unethical practice, and the ethical conduct that he owns to his professional workplace. Superficially, the two cannot coexist. The former prompts him to defect from the unethical practice by his company while the latter forces him to proceed with his duties as an employee. However, not everything has to be black and white. Meaning, quitting and running away from the job is not the only way to demonstrate ethics in software engineering.

If I was in a similar situation, I would have done the following:
1. Observe that what the company is doing does not break any laws. If it does, halt immediately, otherwise continue.
2. Publicly voice my concern about an unethical practice taking place to the supervisor. If the response is positive, then we are      successful. Else, continue.
3. Continue to express concern, but also continue to work on the project.

In the case that the the company’s actions are illegal, we assume that the laws were written fairly and that nobody will be able to blame us for spoiling our duties as a contracted employee. And since we did not engage in the company’s unethical practice, we have not violated any moral or work standards. If the company’s actions are legal, and if after expressing concern, the company halts its unethical operations, we have once again not violated ethical standards and therefore we are okay. If the company does not falter and continues the unethical operations, we can fulfill our two duties by continuing to express concern and at the same time working on the project. In this way, we can be ethical yet still maintain a neutral and favorable position in the society.
