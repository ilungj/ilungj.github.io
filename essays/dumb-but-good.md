title: Dumb, but Good Question

There's no such thing as a dumb question. This is a cliche that a lot of teachers use in order to encourage their students to ask questions. I know better to avoid cringy cliches in my writings, but I had to bring this up because I find it interesting that there are more than one way to interpret this statement. While there really is no dumb question that you shouldn't be asking for learning purposes, there are questions that you shouldn't be asking in the context of social norms.

The big factors that determine whether a question is dumb or not isn't about what the question is asking, but rather where and how you're asking the question. The reason why this is so important is that when you're asking a question on a forum like StackOverflow, you're publishing your writing for everyone on the net to see. Yes, this implies that your potential employers can see it, too. That's why it's important to create positive evidence for employers to evaluate you on, by asking smart questions. While you can't assume what kind of knowledge background your potential employers are from, you do know what they're always looking for: professionalism. Therefore, the easiest way to ask smart question is by demonstrating professionalism in your questions.

Let's see how asking a question professionally makes your question look like a smart question. Take a look at the following question on StackOverflow: <a>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/345838/ball-to-ball-collision-detection-and-handling</a>

The question at hand is about collision detection, which is not a difficult subject. Collision is taught at lower level physics courses in college, and implementation of collision handling in programs is just about mimicking the physics formulas. But I still think that this question is a smart question for two reasons- it's free of grammatical errors and organized very clearly for everybody to see.

On the other hand, this is an example of a bad question: <a>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1277107/collision-detection-with-lots-of-objects?noredirect=1&lq=1</a>

This question asks about the same concept (collision detection) as the first question, but is not as smart as the first question. Personally, as I was reading this, the biggest turn-off was its lack of attention to grammar / spelling and formality. For example, the title is written in all lowercase, and in the content, "stayin" and "tho" are misspelt. It's also informal- the questioner includes ":)" smiley faces every two lines, and "collision" is ambiguously abbreviated as "coll". Using colloquial language is sometimes helpful in getting your message across, but with all of these spelling errors and incorrect grammar usuage, the message that I'm getting is unprofessionalism.

You don't necessarily need to talk super intellectually when you're asking a question. It can even be a "dumb" question, by which I mean non-high level knowledge questions. People are going to understand if you don't understand a concept quite yet, but they will likely frown if you ask it in a very unprofessional way.
