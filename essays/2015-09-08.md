It's already been a year since I started studying computer science, and I feel that I like everything that I do. Although it was a rough transition from being an economics / international relations student to being someone in a completely different field, there's a sense of satisfaction that I didn't have before.

My current part-time jobs are my first technical jobs (I work for a vendor and for a school at my university). At first I didn't how well I would do in the IT field. I was warned by people around me that jobs in the IT field can get boring really fast, and that a great deal of work that I do will become mundane and stagnant. Also, I personally thought that there weren't that many things that I could learn from the job. 

After working in the field for a few months,  I was able to clear some of my doubts. Perhaps it's because I haven't reached that mature stage yet, but as of right now, I enjoy everything that I do. I love bringing dead computers to life, making deployments, and making sure that the machines work for a long time. I think I just like being able to sit down and work closely with the computers. It puts me at ease.
There is actually an abundance of learning material in this career field. While working, I learned about the hardware components and their interaction, imaging, Microsoft's active directory services, networking concepts like VPN, subnetting, DHCP and DNS routing, and how to use various administrative tools. These may be technical concepts that anybody can learn, but with all of the problem solving and troubleshooting that I do at work, what I really learned was how to apply these concepts to real life situations.

Now as I continue my schoolwork, explore programming on my free time, and get exposed to hackathons, I'm excited to see what's waiting ahead of me. This further solidifies my appreciation of and the confidence in the fact that I really enjoy what I do in computer science.
