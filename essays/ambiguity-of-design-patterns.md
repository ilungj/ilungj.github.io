My favorite design pattern has to be the observer pattern. In fact, it is an inseparable component of many popular web application development tools like Angular 2 with RxJS and Meteor. And in the past one year of experience of developing web applications, I have unknowingly embraced this concept in many of my projects.

I have no complaints about the utility of design patterns. Once I got over the initial confusion, I saw how useful it was in maintaining the decoupling of different components in my application while at the same time having those objects and classes communicate with each other. Because of the popularity of this pattern, I could also be confident that other developers can easily understand and contribute to my code.

However, with a bit of research, I was quickly cast with some doubts about how consistent the concept stands across the field of software engineering.

Can there be any more new design patterns (that are not based on the common design patterns)? Are they necessary?

Who acknowledges the new design patterns then? The authors of Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software who first published the idea?

Design patterns is loosely defined as best practices that have proven to work over time. How can one justify that a particular design pattern worked well over time? For how long does it have to work? 5 years? 10 years?

I was left with the impression that the biggest problem with design patterns is their lack of formality. They lack a central authoritative source that provides rigid, consistent documentation of each idea. One may find several definitions online or in print describing a particular design pattern with the same pattern name, but whose descriptions may differ. There is not a single authority whom we can ask the questions I stated above and get answers that we know are unanimously true.

By virtue of its definition, design patterns also grant permission for new ideas to be defined as a design pattern, as long as they have proven to work for a long period of time. But again, there is not a definitive authority that dictates this standard.

If we can arbitrary define an idea to be a design pattern, can we curtail an existing design patternâ€™s right to be considered a design pattern as well? Just a little thought.
