Overview
<br>
The problem: Not all UH students are fond of learning math. We need a better way for students to be motivated while at the same time help them learn in a more friendly and fun environment.

The solution: Meteor offers great reactivity and seemless integration between client and server. It's the perfect medium to create an online game with. We could create a multiplayer speed quiz game that matches players and quizzes them on math problems. Players can compete against and motivate each other real time and have fun while learning math.

Beyond the Basics
<ul>
<li>User can receive certain amount of points per game. We can rank the players based on their experience level, and users can see where they're at on a leaderboard relative to other players. </li>
